# Development

![](https://github.com/actions/namehillsoftware/projectBlue/workflows/.github/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development 
and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Java SDK 8+ and the Android SDK are required to develop project blue. To perform a continuous integration 
(CI) build, Docker and Docker Compose are required.

### Installing

1. Clone this repository
2. Install Android Studio, along with the Android SDK
3. Build and run!

## Running the tests

Run the tests via the IDE.

## Running the Build

Android Studio can perform the build. To run a CI build like it is run in Github, run the following command:

```shell script
./build-github-pr.sh
```

This will leave artifacts that are owned by the root user. To run a build that leaves artifacts
owned by the current user, run either `./build-release.sh` or `./build-apk.sh`.

## Deployment

Once changes are merged, a build will be deployed and published by the project blue maintainer.

## Built With

- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) - Dependency and Build Management
- [Android Studio and SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/) - Tools and standard library for Android
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - Language project blue is migrating to
- [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) - Majority of the project is written in Java
- [Handoff](https://github.com/namehillsoftware/handoff) - Continuations library

## Contributing

All code considered guilty until proven innocent! Please ensure that your code is proven with unit 
tests before submitting a PR. No PR will be considered without the tests to back it up.

All new changes should be written in Kotlin if possible.

Folder structure is organized by **feature**, or rather, it doesn't use the "sock drawer" folder structure
that Android follows. It is inspired by this post on AngularJS project structure (another Google framework that
encourage sock drawer app structuring): http://cliffmeyers.com/blog/2013/4/21/code-organization-angularjs-javascript.
This means everything is logically grouped in nested folders based on feature. Unfortunately, some 
areas, such as the `res` folders, do not allow such structuring.

Finding issues and reporting them is also contributing to making project blue better! Please submit any 
issues that are found in the issues area.

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details on our code of conduct, and the 
process for submitting pull requests to us.
